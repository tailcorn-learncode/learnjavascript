Title: Reporting Screen Design

Description: The system should allow users to navigate through a reporting screen where they can view a list of report names, select and customize a report, and then save and retrieve their preferences for a tailored reporting experience.

Acceptance Criteria:

Report Name Listing:

The reporting screen should display a data table with available report names.
Users should be able to select any report name to access its detail and customization page.
Report Customization:

Within the report detail page, options should be provided for users to select the type of report view (e.g. table, chart, etc.).
Users should be able to choose the headers/columns they want to display in the report and have the option to remove any they deem unnecessary.
Users should have the capability to select specific metric types for display in the footer of the data table.
The data display grid should offer pagination for navigating through extensive data sets.
Users should be able to sort the data table by any column header in ascending or descending order.
Preference Storage and Retrieval:

After customizing a report, users should be given an option to save their preferences.
When revisiting a previously customized report, the system should apply the saved preferences automatically.
An option should be available for users to reset the report view/settings to the default.
Report Download:

Users should be able to download their customized report in a chosen format (e.g. PDF, Excel, etc.).
Responsive and User-friendly UI:

Both the reporting screen and customization page should be intuitive with a user-friendly interface.
Tooltips or help icons should be integrated next to functionalities that might be complex for users.
