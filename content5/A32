Tasks:

Task 1: Implement Token Retrieval
Description:

As a system tester,

I want to configure Locust to use tenantid, clientid, clientsecret, scope, and issuerUrl to request and retrieve an access token,

so that I can use this token for authenticated requests to the WhoAmI endpoint.

Acceptance Criteria:
Given the Locust script is configured with tenantid, clientid, clientsecret, scope, and issuerUrl,

When the script requests an access token,

Then the token should be successfully obtained using the provided credentials.

Task 2: Perform Load Test on WhoAmI Endpoint
Description:

As a system tester,

I want to configure Locust to call the WhoAmI endpoint at http://crmapp/api/data/v9.2/WhoAmI using the obtained authorization bearer token,

so that I can verify the endpoint's performance and reliability under load.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given the access token is obtained,
When the Locust script calls the WhoAmI endpoint at http://crmapp/api/data/v9.2/WhoAmI,

Then the call should include the authorization bearer token in the header.

Given the WhoAmI endpoint is called with the correct authorization,

When the Locust script performs the load test,

Then the WhoAmI endpoint should respond appropriately and handle the load without errors or performance degradation.
