### User Story Description: Panels Management Based on Case Selection

**Overview:**  
This user story focuses on enhancing the user navigation experience on the ESS project's homepage by dynamically displaying panels as tabs based on the selected case.

**User Journey:**

1. **Homepage Interaction:**
   - The user accesses the ESS project's homepage.
   - On hovering over a menu, the system displays a list of cases related to the hovered menu item.

2. **Case Selection:**
   - The user selects a case from the displayed list.
   - The system captures the selected case's ID through the route parameters (`routeparam`).

3. **Dynamic Panel Display:**
   - On case selection, the system calls a service to fetch panels associated with the selected case's ID (`caseid`).
   - The system then displays these panels grouped as tabs on the page.

4. **Case-Specific Tabs:**
   - Each case selection leads to a unique set of tabs representing different panels associated with that case.
   - For instance:
     - Selecting "Work on Reports" displays tabs such as "Unposted", "Posted", "Create".
     - Selecting "Payments" shows a different set of tabs relevant to the payments case.

5. **Component Creation:**
   - Dedicated components for cases like "Work on Reports", "Payments", etc., are created.
   - Each component is responsible for retrieving and displaying panels based on their respective `caseid`.

**Data Integration:**
   - Panels are filled with relevant data fetched from the database.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Menu Interaction:**
   - Verify that hovering over a menu item displays a list of related cases.

2. **Case Selection Routing:**
   - Ensure that selecting a case routes the user to the correct page with the case name displayed.
   - Confirm that the case ID is correctly captured from the route parameters.

3. **Dynamic Tabs Display:**
   - Check that panels related to the selected case are displayed as tabs.
   - Validate that the tabs change dynamically based on the selected case.

4. **Case-Specific Panel Accuracy:**
   - Test for accurate display of tabs for different cases (e.g., "Work on Reports" should show "Unposted", "Posted", "Create" tabs).
   - Ensure that each case shows its respective, relevant tabs.

5. **Component Functionality:**
   - Confirm that components for different cases (like "Work on Reports", "Payments") are created and function correctly.
   - Verify that these components fetch and display panels based on their specific `caseid`.

6. **Data Integration and Display:**
   - Check that panels display data accurately pulled from the database.

7. **Usability and Navigation:**
   - Ensure smooth navigation and interaction with the menu, case selection, and tab displays.
   - Test for intuitive and user-friendly interface design.
