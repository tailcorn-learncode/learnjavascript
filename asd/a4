I want to write description and accceptance criteria for my user story neatly step by step which I explained below.
write keeping in mind user navigation, as if user navigating, this is for project ESS for internal ess user


When user comes to homepage, he an select hover on menu and it shows cases related to menu and when case selected, it should route to the page where we 
show panels based on cases. So, the task is Panels management based on case. 
So, page will have case name, List of panels shown as tabs.
Display panels grouped by cases as tabs based on caseid. Fill with some Data in Database.

More Details about above points..

1. once user clicks on case (hover on menu and click any case)
   catch the case id (from routeparam)
   call service to get panels based on caseid
   show panels as tabs

For example:
   when user clicks on work on reports case, show 3 tabs as unposted,posted,create which are panels belonging to work on reports case
   and when user clicks on another case like payments, show tabs which belongs to payment
 
   So, create components for cases workonreports, payments to show it when required

   In this each component we get panels based on respective caseid
