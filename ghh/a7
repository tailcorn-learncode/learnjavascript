Title: Utilize existing Figma components to design pages based on business discussions.

Description:
As a UI/UX Designer, I need to utilize the basic building block components developed in Figma using Angular Material Design to craft comprehensive wireframes and page designs. These designs will be based on the outcomes and needs identified during previous business meetings. Throughout the design phase, I'll be closely collaborating with the development team to ensure that the designs are compatible and feasible. Any ambiguities or information gaps will be clarified with the business team as needed.

Acceptance Criteria:

Component Utilization: All designs should primarily utilize the predefined Figma components developed with Angular Material Design.

Business Alignment: The wireframes and page designs should mirror the specifications and requirements highlighted during previous business discussions.

Design Continuity: Ensure that there's a consistent look and feel across all pages, leveraging the basic building block components.

Development Collaboration: Regular check-ins with the development team to address any compatibility or implementation issues that may arise.

Feedback Loop: After initial designs are drafted, obtain feedback from both the development team and the business team to ensure alignment and feasibility.

Information Clarity: In cases of ambiguities or unclear specifications, actively reach out to the business team to seek clarifications.

Responsiveness: The designs should account for various device sizes and screen resolutions, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Design Iterations: Based on feedback and collaboration, be ready to iterate on the designs to ensure they align with the project goals and objectives.

Documentation: Every design decision that deviates from the established components or introduces a new design pattern should be documented and justified.

Final Review: Conduct a final review with stakeholders to ensure all business requirements have been met and to confirm that the development team has all the resources they need for implementation.
