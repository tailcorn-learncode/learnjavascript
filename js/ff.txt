Cypress plugin setup..

Cypress also provides a number of plugins that can be installed to enhance its functionality. To install a Cypress plugin, you can run the following command in your terminal:

npm install cypress-plugin-name --save-dev

Replace cypress-plugin-name with the name of the plugin you want to install. After installing the plugin, you will need to configure it in your cypress.json file or in a Cypress command file

After installing and configuring the Cypress plugin, you will need to import it in your test files. To import a plugin in your test files, you can use the following syntax:

const pluginName = require('cypress-plugin-name');

Once the plugin is imported, you can use its API to extend the functionality of your tests. For example, if you have installed a plugin that adds a custom command to Cypress, you can use that command in your tests just like any other Cypress command.

It's important to note that Cypress plugins can have different requirements and configuration options, so be sure to check the documentation for the specific plugin you are using.

By using plugins, you can add new functionality to Cypress and make it easier to write and run tests for your application.



Git introduction..

Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes made to your projects, collaborate with others, and maintain multiple versions of your project at once. Here are some basic concepts in Git:

Repository: A repository (often abbreviated as "repo") is a place to store your project and its associated files, including all historical versions. A repository can be stored locally on your computer or remotely on a server.

Commit: A commit is a change or addition you make to your project. Each commit has a unique identifier (a "commit hash") and contains a message describing the change you made.

Branch: A branch is a separate line of development within a repository. You can use branches to experiment with new features or to isolate changes that you want to merge back into the main line of development later.

Merge: A merge is the act of integrating changes from one branch into another branch. This is typically used when you want to bring changes made on a separate branch back into the main line of development.

Push and Pull: "Push" and "pull" are Git commands that allow you to transfer data between your local repository and a remote repository. "Push" sends your changes to the remote repository, while "pull" retrieves changes from the remote repository and updates your local repository.

Clone: "Clone" is a Git command that creates a copy of a remote repository on your local computer. This is often used when you want to start working on a project that is stored on a remote server.

Conflict: A conflict occurs when two people make changes to the same line of the same file in a repository. Git provides tools to help you resolve these conflicts and merge the changes into a single version of the file.



node basic folder structure and npm install..

A typical Node.js project has the following basic folder structure:

project_folder/
|-- node_modules/
|-- public/
|-- src/
|-- .gitignore
|-- package.json
|-- package-lock.json
|-- README.md

Here's what each of these components does:

node_modules/: This folder contains all the packages and dependencies that your project needs. The node_modules/ folder is generated when you run the npm install command.

public/: This folder contains any static assets that you want to serve to clients, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

src/: This folder contains your project's source code, organized into modules and components.

.gitignore: This file lists the files and directories that should be ignored by Git when tracking changes in your project.

package.json: This file is the manifest file for your project. It lists the dependencies, scripts, and other metadata for your project.

package-lock.json: This file is generated automatically when you run the npm install command. It lists the exact versions of all the packages and dependencies that your project uses, which helps ensure consistent behavior across different environments.

README.md: This file contains information about your project, such as how to install and use it, and who contributed to it.

To install the dependencies for a Node.js project, you can run the following command in your terminal:

npm install

This command will look at the dependencies listed in the package.json file and download the required packages and dependencies into the node_modules/ folder. 



how to add folders in vscode?

You can add a new workspace in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) by following these steps:

Click on the "File" menu in the top-left corner of the window, and select "Open Workspace...".

In the "Open Workspace" dialog, select the folder you want to add as a workspace. You can either navigate to the folder using the file explorer or type in the path to the folder in the "File name" field.

Once you have selected the folder, click the "Open" button to add it as a workspace.

VSCode will open the selected folder as a new workspace, and you can start adding and editing files, creating new folders, and using other VSCode features.

You can also add a new workspace by using the Command Palette. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl + Shift + P (or Cmd + Shift + P on Mac), and type "Open Workspace". Select the command from the list and follow the steps above to add a new workspace.

It's important to note that workspaces in VSCode are collections of files and folders that are stored together in a single place, and they allow you to manage your projects more effectively. By adding a new workspace, you can create a new project or group of files, and have them all in one place for easy access and management.


how to clone git repository in vscode?

To clone a Git repository in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), you can use the built-in Git support in the Source Control panel. Here's how:

Open the Source Control panel by clicking on the Source Control icon in the left-side panel, or by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + G (or Cmd + Shift + G on Mac).

Click on the "..." button in the Source Control panel, and select "Clone Repository".

In the "Clone Repository" dialog, enter the URL of the repository you want to clone, and choose the local folder where you want to store the cloned repository. You can also specify whether to open the cloned repository in the current window or in a new window.

Click the "Clone" button to start the cloning process. VSCode will download the repository, and you will be able to access its contents in the File explorer.

It's important to note that you need to have Git installed on your computer in order to use Git in VSCode. If you don't have Git installed, you can download it from the official Git website.

Once the repository is cloned, you can start using Git in VSCode to manage your changes, create branches, and push your changes to the remote repository. The Source Control panel provides you with a visual representation of your Git history, and you can use it to manage your Git repository without having to use the command line.
