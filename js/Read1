Cypress and UFT (Unified Functional Testing) are both tools for automating the testing of web applications, but they have some key differences.

Cypress is a relatively new tool that is designed for modern web applications. It is built on JavaScript and can be integrated with other JavaScript testing frameworks like Mocha and Chai. Cypress also has a simple and intuitive API, which makes it easy to use for developers who are already familiar with JavaScript. Additionally, Cypress has a built-in browser-based test runner and supports real-time reloads, making it easy to test and debug tests in a live environment.

UFT, on the other hand, is a more mature tool that has been around for a while. It is developed by MicroFocus (formerly HP) and it is a commercial tool that includes a license fee. UFT supports a wide range of technologies, including web, mobile, and desktop applications, and it has a variety of features, such as record and replay, for creating and running automated tests. UFT also has a built-in object repository and support for keyword-driven testing.

In summary, Cypress is a modern, JavaScript-based tool that is easy to use and has a simple API. UFT is a more mature tool that supports a wide range of technologies and has a variety of features for creating and running automated tests. Cypress is open source and free while UFT is commercial tool.

It depends on your project requirements, if you are working on modern web applications with JavaScript-based stack, Cypress is a good fit, but if you are working with a wide range of technologies, UFT is a better option, and if you are in a regulated Industry UFT might be mandated by security and compliance standards.
