MILogin Help Instructions


As you may be aware, the Michigan Office of Retirement Services (ORS) recently adopted the state of Michigan's single sign-on standard, MILogin, for miAccount. The new standard requires a multifactor authentication before you can login to miAccount to increase security.


Some members have experienced issues in the transition to the new login portal. We created this guide to help you access your miAccount.

Welcome to the Michigan Office of Retirement Services (ORS) website for members of the Michigan Public School Employees' Retirement System who began public school employment before July 1, 2010.

Retirement is a journey; ORS is here to help you along yours. During your career, your employer takes care of your pension plan deductions, wage and service records, and plan contributions. Your employer sends regular wage and service reports to ORS that become part of your personal pension record. When it's time to retire, your employer hands off your final records to ORS, and we become your partner in retirement. ORS manages the retirement system carefully to preserve it for you and other future retirees.

---->> HONORS 


Public Pension Standards Award : ORS was awarded the 2019 Standards Award from the Public Pension Coordinating Councils Standards Program (PPCC) for both funding and administration. ORS has received this award every year since 2004. The PPCC Standards reflect expectations for public retirement system management and administration, and serve as a benchmark for all defined benefit public plans to be measured.



Government Finance Officers Association Award : The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada awarded the retirement system with the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting for our fiscal year 2018 comprehensive annual financial report. This marks the 28th consecutive year ORS has received this prestigious award.



Signature Award Winner : ORS with Voya Financial won a 2019 Signature Award from the Plan Sponsor Council of America. We took first place in the Overcoming Obstacles category for our MPSERS outreach campaign. An annual review of plan data revealed that the approximately 72,000 participants in the Defined Contribution plan in the public school population did not engage with their accounts or online tools as much as their State of Michigan employee counterparts. The outreach campaign used a variety of communication methods to reach public school employees and human resources administrators. These methods included publications, a telephone campaign, meetings for public school employees, emails, and an innovative social media campaign on LinkedIn. Member behaviors exceeded expectations and surpassed industry benchmarks for both click-through rate and engagement rate. The Plan Sponsor Council of America, which is part of the American Retirement Association, is the leading association for sponsors of voluntary, employer-based retirement plans in the U.S.
