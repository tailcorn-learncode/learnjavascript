routing unopinionated...

routing attached to css selector like id,
so free to add route when required wherever possible

we can put history only for urls we want


less coding..

alpine - less boilerplate code to write component js
angular - minimum boiler plate code needed in angular component js

alpinejs heavily declarative (we can even skip js file)
angular less declarative

less coding with declarations, updates, reactivity etc., 
alpine js - straight forward - x-data="{x:null}" x='test'
angular js - functional - x = signal(null) x.update('test')


integration with visual editing (pinegrow) because we can catch html...
its very important because for user facing apps require more ui when compared to internal portals.
we can do both landing page & portal same time or any complex ui

easy to see components as html file, easy to understand

on demand html,js load

remote load allowed

web components integration is easy. you can include any components with any language easily

any complex logic we can do in vanila javascript because alpine doesn't involve with framework, you are free
to use (ex: voice recording etc.,)

easy to understand for people in other technologies (not from angular) because its just html,css,javascript
htmx, alpinejs anyone can learn easily in short time


bundling unopinionated...
free to write any complex bundling funcitions easily


only disadvantage is writing some extra codes to make it professional
