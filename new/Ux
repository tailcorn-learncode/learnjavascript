When the user opens the data table, they should see a clear and organized display of the data, including all relevant columns and rows.
The data table should have pagination or scroll functionality if the number of rows exceeds the available space, ensuring that the user can easily navigate through the data.
The table should provide a sorting option for each column, allowing the user to sort the data in ascending or descending order based on a specific column.
Users should be able to add new data entries to the table. There should be a clearly labeled "Add" button that opens a form or modal where users can input the required data.
Upon submitting the form for adding a new entry, the table should dynamically update to include the new data at the appropriate position based on any sorting or filtering applied.
Users should be able to edit existing data entries in the table. Each row in the table should have an "Edit" button that opens a form or modal pre-filled with the existing data.
After making changes in the edit form or modal and submitting it, the corresponding entry in the table should update to reflect the edited values.
The edit form or modal should provide validation for required fields and display appropriate error messages if any required fields are left blank or if the data entered is invalid.
Users should be able to easily navigate back to the data table after completing an add or edit action, ensuring a smooth workflow.
The data table and its functionalities should be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and orientations, providing a consistent user experience across devices.
