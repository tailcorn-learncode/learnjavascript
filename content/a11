Title:

As a <type of iser>

I want to <perform some task>

so that I can <achieve some goal>


Acceptance criteria

Given <some context>

When <some action is carried out>

Then <a set of observable outcomes should occur>


details:

Menu navigation, all components aligned with Figma. Design should match like figma.

Implement security by passing jwt token, headers with app_code which is based on applications - Atlas, ESS, Member. Get access token for authenticated user in oauth2proxy at front end.

Add validation login in Atlas microservice and make sure the user has role. If not invalidate the request.
If valid allow the API request for other microservices like ESS, Member

Integrate all components in front end and verify if any broken links and get required user information from access token

Title: Enhancing User Interface Alignment and Security Integration
As a developer,

I want to align all menu components with the design specified in Figma and implement security measures by passing a JWT token and headers with an app_code specific to applications (Atlas, ESS, Member), as well as add validation logic in the Atlas microservice to ensure the user has the appropriate role,

so that I can ensure the application's design is consistent with the Figma prototype and enhance the security and usability of our application by managing authenticated user access and role-based validation effectively.

Acceptance Criteria
Given a user interacts with the application,

When the user navigates the menu,

Then all components should be aligned as specified in the Figma design, ensuring a seamless user interface.

Given a user attempts to authenticate,

When the user provides their credentials,

Then the system should pass a JWT token and headers with an app_code related to Atlas, ESS, or Member applications to authenticate the user and obtain an access token via oauth2proxy at the front end.

Given an authenticated user attempts to access the Atlas microservice,

When a request is made,

Then the system should validate the user's role within the Atlas microservice; if the user does not have the appropriate role, the request should be invalidated, otherwise, allow the API request for other microservices like ESS, Member.

Given a user is interacting with the front-end application,

When the user navigates between different components,

Then the system should integrate all components seamlessly, verify there are no broken links, and retrieve the required user information from the access token, ensuring a functional and secure user experience.

Then <a set of observable outcomes should occur>


details:

Post man API test in all microservice projects (admin, ess, member and document).
Write/Test all Get,Post,Put,Delete API calls for all microservices.
Pass Headers api_code and access_code for all microservices and validate.
Verify responses or proper errors from api calls.
Store all api's in collection with proper namings.
Make sure these collections when exported and imported by any other developer or tester, those should work as it is

Title: Comprehensive API Testing Across Microservices
As a developer/tester,

I want to write and test all GET, POST, PUT, DELETE API calls for all microservices (admin, ESS, member, and document) and ensure proper header validation,

so that I can verify the functionality and error handling of all APIs, maintain a well-organized collection of APIs, and ensure these collections are portable and functional when used by other developers or testers.

Acceptance Criteria
Given a set of API endpoints in microservices projects (admin, ESS, member, and document),

When I execute GET, POST, PUT, DELETE calls,

Then the system should correctly handle these requests, pass headers api_code and access_code for validation, and return appropriate responses or error messages.

Given a collection of API calls for all microservices,

When I store these APIs in a collection with proper naming conventions,

Then these collections should be easily identifiable and categorized by their functionality and microservice association.

Given a collection of API calls,

When this collection is exported and imported by another developer or tester,

Then the collection should work without requiring additional configuration or modifications, ensuring portability and consistency across development and testing environments.
