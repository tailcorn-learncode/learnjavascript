Given below is user story details, need to rewrite them in below format


Title:

As a <type of iser>

I want to <perform some task>

so that I can <achieve some goal>


Acceptance criteria

Given <some context>

When <some action is carried out>

Then <a set of observable outcomes should occur>


details:

Menu navigation, all components aligned with Figma. Design should match like figma.

Implement security by passing jwt token, headers with app_code which is based on applications - Atlas, ESS, Member. Get access token for authenticated user in oauth2proxy at front end.

Add validation login in Atlas microservice and make sure the user has role. If not invalidate the request.
If valid allow the API request for other microservices like ESS, Member

Integrate all components in front end and verify if any broken links and get required user information from access token

Title: Enhancing User Interface Alignment and Security Integration
As a developer,

I want to align all menu components with the design specified in Figma and implement security measures by passing a JWT token and headers with an app_code specific to applications (Atlas, ESS, Member), as well as add validation logic in the Atlas microservice to ensure the user has the appropriate role,

so that I can ensure the application's design is consistent with the Figma prototype and enhance the security and usability of our application by managing authenticated user access and role-based validation effectively.

Acceptance Criteria
Given a user interacts with the application,

When the user navigates the menu,

Then all components should be aligned as specified in the Figma design, ensuring a seamless user interface.

Given a user attempts to authenticate,

When the user provides their credentials,

Then the system should pass a JWT token and headers with an app_code related to Atlas, ESS, or Member applications to authenticate the user and obtain an access token via oauth2proxy at the front end.

Given an authenticated user attempts to access the Atlas microservice,

When a request is made,

Then the system should validate the user's role within the Atlas microservice; if the user does not have the appropriate role, the request should be invalidated, otherwise, allow the API request for other microservices like ESS, Member.

Given a user is interacting with the front-end application,

When the user navigates between different components,

Then the system should integrate all components seamlessly, verify there are no broken links, and retrieve the required user information from the access token, ensuring a functional and secure user experience.
