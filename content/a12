Title: Implementing Playwright Testing Framework with CI/CD Pipeline to Azure Cloud

As a developer,

I want to set up Playwright boilerplate code utilizing the Page Object Model, develop a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline for the Playwright testing framework, and write a build pipeline to deploy the Playwright code to Azure Cloud,

so that I can ensure seamless code deployment to the main branch and facilitate efficient and reliable automated testing and deployment processes.

Acceptance Criteria

Given the existing codebase and Azure Cloud setup,

When the code is committed to the main branch,

Then the following observable outcomes should occur:

The Playwright boilerplate code, which adheres to the Page Object Model, is successfully initiated and verified for consistency.
The CI/CD pipeline triggers automatically, executing the predefined tests using the Playwright framework.
The build pipeline compiles and packages the Playwright code, and deploys it to the Azure Cloud environment without manual intervention.
The deployment is logged, and any deployment errors are clearly reported for immediate rectification.
