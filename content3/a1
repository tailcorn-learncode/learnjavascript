Given below is user story details, need to rewrite them in below format


Title:

As a <type of iser>

I want to <perform some task>

so that I can <achieve some goal>


Acceptance criteria

Given <some context>

When <some action is carried out>

Then <a set of observable outcomes should occur>


details:

Create an Error and Exception Handling interface for all modules
For example

Global Exception Handler

Instead of catching and throwing Exceptions in the controllers methods, keep them simple by using a global ExceptionHandler using @ConrollerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler

 
@ControllerAdvice
public class RestResponseEntityExceptionHandler 

  extends ResponseEntityExceptionHandler {

 

    @ExceptionHandler(value 

      = { IllegalArgumentException.class, IllegalStateException.class })

    protected ResponseEntity<Object> handleConflict(

      RuntimeException ex, WebRequest request) {

        String bodyOfResponse = "This should be application specific";

        return handleExceptionInternal(ex, bodyOfResponse, 

          new HttpHeaders(), HttpStatus.CONFLICT, request);

    }

}


Error and Exception handling defines all the common error and throws exceptions.
Can be used in all modules.
