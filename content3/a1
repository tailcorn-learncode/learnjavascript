Title: Implementing a Global Exception Handling Mechanism

As a developer,

I want to create an Error and Exception Handling interface for all modules,

so that I can streamline error handling across the application and keep controller methods clean.

Acceptance Criteria

Given an application with multiple modules,

When an exception occurs in any of the modules,

Then the global ExceptionHandler should catch and handle the exception, providing a standardized response without requiring exception handling code in the controller methods.

Specifically,

The global ExceptionHandler will be implemented using @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler annotations.
It will catch exceptions such as IllegalArgumentException and IllegalStateException.
It will return a standardized ResponseEntity object with a custom message, appropriate HTTP status code, and headers.
This mechanism will ensure that all modules can utilize a consistent strategy for error and exception handling, simplifying maintenance and improving code readability.








Given below is user story details, need to rewrite them in below format


Title:

As a <type of iser>

I want to <perform some task>

so that I can <achieve some goal>


Acceptance criteria

Given <some context>

When <some action is carried out>

Then <a set of observable outcomes should occur>


details:

Create an Error and Exception Handling interface for all modules
For example

Global Exception Handler

Instead of catching and throwing Exceptions in the controllers methods, keep them simple by using a global ExceptionHandler using @ConrollerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler

 
@ControllerAdvice
public class RestResponseEntityExceptionHandler 

  extends ResponseEntityExceptionHandler {

 

    @ExceptionHandler(value 

      = { IllegalArgumentException.class, IllegalStateException.class })

    protected ResponseEntity<Object> handleConflict(

      RuntimeException ex, WebRequest request) {

        String bodyOfResponse = "This should be application specific";

        return handleExceptionInternal(ex, bodyOfResponse, 

          new HttpHeaders(), HttpStatus.CONFLICT, request);

    }

}


Error and Exception handling defines all the common error and throws exceptions.
Can be used in all modules.
