In angular environment.ts

export const environment = {
    production: false,   
    auth_url:'http://localhost:8181/gateway/api/auth',
    app_url: 'http://localhost:8181/gateway/api',
};

I want to put baseurl as dynamic, get from address url, so i can only give relative paths like

export const environment = {
    production: false,   
    auth_url:'/gateway/api/auth',
    app_url: '/gateway/api',
};

write code to implement this
